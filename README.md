This project is testing ability of Regration models and compare its effectiveness....
The data set used to train model is highly complecated mathametical formulas and functions with four diffrent variables.
Non linear mathemetical functions like log() sin() and power() are used to calculate result
Total 50000 data sets are used to train the model for better accuracy.
accuracy achieved - 99.99999% with Random Forest Regressor.
